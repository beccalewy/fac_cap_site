    <h2>Co-founder and CEO of Hugging Face</h2>
    <p>
        Matt was a partner at Betaworks when it funded Clement Delangue, Julien Chaumond and Thomas Wolf with a “quit your job” check to start Hugging Face. Since then, Hugging Face has become the default platform for artificial intelligence. Over 1,000 startups are built on top of Hugging Face today. We're teaming up to write ~$100k checks into new startups building AI-first companies, and are especially interested in companies building in and around the Hugging Face ecosystem.
